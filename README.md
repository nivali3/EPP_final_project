# IDEA STORAGE

IDEA 1: Add an extra cost function and do the analysis again ...

IDEA 2: In the NLS estimation instead of using 100 point bins use continuous point score using maximum likelihood.

IDEA 3 (MAIN): Using estimagic/Replace scipy with estimagic. In other words, do the optimization using estimagic instead of scipy!

JUPYTER NOTEBOOK - table_5_6_NLS, Cell 6: Maybe the difference between replicated numbers and original numbers are because in the "power cost function" case it is LOG of effort ...

QUESTION: In table_5_6_NLS, how does the initial values for k, g, and s guessed? 

First Task: `table_5_6_nls.ipynb`- TRY to re-do the code using estimagic.

## REMEMBER: Fix the PATH in the files at the end!



QUESTION: Would it matter if we store all the generated outpus in .csv files or should we store them in .yaml and only final ones in .csv?

In table_5_6_NLS, how does the initial values for k, g, and s guessed?
